                    <h2>Photography</h2>
                    <p>
                        Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating
                        images by recording light, either electronically by means of an
                        image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material
                        such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of
                        science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as
                        well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production,
                        recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.[1]
                        Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted
                        from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface
                        inside a camera during a timed exposure. printing.

                        With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
                        charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored
                        in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The
                        result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image,
                        which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either
                        negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic
                        material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is
                        traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on
                        a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by
